          <p class="is-size-4"><b>Synopsis:</b> Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer, an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on "push-forward" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, BFG 9000, and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the "Crucible Blade" energy sword and a retractable arm-blade can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent "glory kill" executions. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with a "Meat Hook", which slingshots the player towards an enemy, functioning as a grappling hook in both combat scenarios and environmental navigation. A new Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs that also dons a Flamethrower that provides armor from burning enemies is now part of the Doom Slayer's armor. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from will also be introduced. <br><br> The game will feature several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including "Battlemode". This game type is a 2v1 PvP multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There will be five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a "summoning wheel", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. These can range from AoE box effects[further explanation needed] to spawning in higher tier NPC demons. An additional mode, called "Invasion", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update. In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons. This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.</p>
